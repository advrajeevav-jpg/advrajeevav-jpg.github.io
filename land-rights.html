      <h2>Your Rights in Land Disputes</h2>
      <p>Land and property disputes are common and complex. Whether it's boundary disagreements, illegal possession, or government acquisition, Indian law provides clear protections under several Acts.</p>

      <h3>1. Right to Clear Title and Ownership</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transfer of Property Act, 1882:</strong> Any property sale must be through a registered sale deed.</li>
        <li><strong>Registration Act, 1908:</strong> All transfers of immovable property above ‚Çπ100 must be registered with the Sub-Registrar.</li>
        <li>Mutation in revenue records is not proof of ownership‚Äîonly registered title deeds are valid.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Illegal Possession & Encroachment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You can file a civil suit for possession under <strong>Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963</strong>, even if you're not the owner.</li>
        <li>Owners can file for permanent injunctions to stop trespassers.</li>
        <li><strong>Police complaint + temporary injunction</strong> from court are common remedies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Government Land Acquisition</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Act, 2013:</strong> Protects your land from forced acquisition.</li>
        <li>Compensation must be at least 2√ó market value in urban and 4√ó in rural areas.</li>
        <li>You can object and appeal the acquisition notice before the Collector and High Court.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Boundary or Title Disputes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Title suits can be filed in civil court with support from survey maps, sale deeds, and tax records.</li>
        <li><strong>Revenue authorities</strong> can demarcate boundaries, especially in rural disputes.</li>
        <li>Adverse possession defenses must show uninterrupted use for 12 years (30 years for government land).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Partition Disputes in Family Property</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Any co-owner can file a <strong>suit for partition</strong> in civil court under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.</li>
        <li>Female heirs now have equal share after 2005 amendment.</li>
        <li>Once partitioned, you get a distinct title and possession.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. How to Get Help</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hire a lawyer for title verification, sale agreement drafting, and dispute resolution.</li>
        <li>Approach the local Taluk or Village Officer for encroachment reports or land records.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always verify land titles, survey numbers, encumbrance certificates, and obtain a legal opinion before purchase.</p>
